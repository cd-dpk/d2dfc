<b>D2D Follow Corona</b>: It is a door-to-door data collection concept related with corona virus (COVID-19).
<p> In this concept, one or two data collectors will go to every house of an assigned or a chosen small region (i.e. para or road)
to collect data of every person in regular basis (i.e. every day or after every one day). The data ranges from each person's
biological information (i.e. sex, age, etc.), travel history and heatlh history (i.e. presence of previously recorded deseases)
to daily corona related symptoms, daily travel and contact trace. The collected data will be sent to an central board consiting
of data scientists and specialized doctors. By analyzing daily data and person's previous bio information, they will be able to
identify probable corona positive cases and take measures to test them quickly. This way will help to isolate the probable
positive cases. As the contact traces are recorded, the contacts of a positive case can easily be identified. </p>

<p>Being traditional pen-n-paper data collection and processing is tedious and time consuming task, we develop mobile application <b>D2D Follow Corona</b>.
A data collector can use this wonderfully developed tool for easy data collection. The application require a <b>Data Collector</b> to be registered.
This registration takes three things, one: <i>area</i>- he/she is collecting data for a region, two: <i>name</i>- his/her name and three:
<i>mobile</i> number- his/her mobile number. The mobile number is for verification and validation of collected data. The Data Collector will export 
daily as CSV files (.i.e. .csv) into <b>Internal Shared Storage</b> with folder named as <b>d2dfc</b>.
Data Collector can send those CSV files to a designated authority to analyze and act accordingly.
